In order to test my code, I will write unit tests for all my modules.
I will have unit tests that test that the module will have the desired output for valid data, boundary data, absent data, and invalid data.
I will test that the invalid and absent data returns the correct responses for the errors they cause, and I will test that the valid and boundary data return a valid output.
I will manually test my makefile.
I will use the check module to write my unit tests.
