proposed Modules:
pgmRead - a module which will read in a pgm file to an array
pgmWrite - a module which will write an array to a pgm file 
pgmBinWrite - a module which will write an array to a binary pgm file
pgmCompare - a module which will take two pgm files as arrays and compare them
pgmReadBinary - a module which will read in a binary pgm file to an array
pgma2b - a module which will convert an ascii pgm file to binary (uses pgmread and pgmbinWrite)
pgmb2a - a module which will convert a binary pgm file to ascii (uses pgmReadBinary and pgmWrite)
pgmReduceSize - a module which will take a pgm array and a factor and output a pgm array reduced by the factor
pgmSubImage - a module which will take a pgm array and a start and end column and a start and end row and output that subimage for those rows and columns
pgmInsert - a module which will take an output image, an input image, and a row and column in the output image to insert the input image.
pgmEmpty - a module which will take a width and length and output a pgm array of width and length specified.

all will use pgmRead, pgmWrite, pgmBinWrite, and pgmReadBinary.
pgmReduce will use pgmReduceSize.
pgmTile will use pgmSubImage.
pgmAssemble will use pgmInsert and pgmEmpty.
