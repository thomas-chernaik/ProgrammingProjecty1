In order to test my code I need to make a bash script.
This bash script needs to compile, then test each of my programs.
It can compare the output of the programs to an expected output using the diff command.
It can test that my programs handle errors correctly.
It can test the output of the programs to an expected output using the gtopoComp program I have written, so long as the tests for gtopoComp pass
I don't need to test gtopoAssemble and gtopoReduce individually as they can be tested simultaneously with gtopoAsssembleReduce
