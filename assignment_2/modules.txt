proposed modules:
gtopoRead - a module which will read the dem file to an array
gtopoWrite - a module which will write an array to a dem file
gtopoCompare - a module which will take two arrays and compare them
gtopoReduceSize - a module which will take an array and a factor and output an array reduced by the factor
gtopoSubImage - a module which will take an array and a start and end column and aend row and output that subImage for those rows and columns
gtopoInsert - a module which will take an output image, an input image and a row and column in the output image to insert the input image.
gtopoEmpty - a module which will take a width and length and output an array of width and length specified
gtopoPrint - a module that will take an image array and output a formatted version of it

all will use gtopoRead and gtopoWrite
gtopoReduce wil use gtopoReduceSize
gtopoTile will use gtopoSubImage
gtopoAssemble will use gtopoInsert and gtopotEmpty
gtopoInsert will use gtopoEmpty
gtopoAssembleReduce will use all that gtopoAssemble and gtopoReduce uses
gtopoPrintLand will use gtopoPrint
All of these modules can be adapted from modules used in assignment_1
